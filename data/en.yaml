summary: |
  Backend developer with <strong>8+ years</strong> of experience, passionate about open-source,
  clean
  architecture and building technical foundations that make teams more effective. I enjoy setting
  up
  strong delivery pipelines, simplifying workflows and creating reliable environments where
  development
  and production behave the same.
  I adapt quickly to new stacks, teams or domains — whether joining an existing project or
  structuring
  a new one, I focus on making things clearer, smoother and easier to maintain.
